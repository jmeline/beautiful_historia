            I am mostly a self-taught artist - which basically translates to doing a lot of research, you-tubing, asking questions at art gallerias and above all practicing. I love painting. I graduated with a degree in psychology and minor in music only to find there isn't any money in those things. Which is fine - I don't do what I do for money, but it sure helps to pay the bills. When I graduated from college I found myself with more time than I had had in a very long time. I had always wanted to take a painting class, and found a wonderful lady who held classes in her home studio. I painted with her once a week for about a year and a half until I gave birth to my little girl. After having my baby I re-realized life is beautiful and especially hard. Change can be a hard thing for anyone - even when you've been preparing for it for 9 months or more. However, without change it is hard to grow as a person. My beautiful little girl inspired me by reminding me that there is more to life - and so I began to paint more seriously about it. Many, if not all, of my paintings have a story or have been inspired by something or someone. Hopefully I can relate the beauty of life and miracle of hard work through my pieces to bring more depth into your homes and offices. 
            Please feel free to contact me if you have questions, suggestions, are an interested buyer, or just want to talk about art. I'm excited to hear from you.
