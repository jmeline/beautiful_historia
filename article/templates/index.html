            <p>
This is the first painting I finished in my paint class. After I graduated with my bachelors in psychology I wanted to reward myself for the last four years of hard work. I had always wanted to take a painting class, I heard of one taught by a lovely grandma. It was hard learning to be patient with myself. If I learned anything on this painting, it was "BE PATIENT". I picked this picture because I thought "oh, that will be an easy picture to start on" and maybe it was, but it sure didn't feel like it. I felt like it took forever to do this one. I worked on this picture every Friday for three hours for 8 months. I loved this picture because of the fall colors and the bridge over water. It looks so serene to me - causing one to really take a step back and remember that sometimes it's worth it to take a breath and take in all the colors around you. Which is exactly what I was not feeling by the end of this painting - but sometimes I'm glad emotions aren't always painted into the picture. </p>
